    <p>Dani is an 11 year old boy with a very weird disease known as Pure Red Cell Aplasia (Diamond Blackfan Anemia). It’s so rare that only 35 cases appear per year in the United States and Canada. Basically, less than 0.001% of the world population has it. The Pure Re Cell Aplasia is caused by the failure of the bone marrow in generating red blood cells. </p>
    <p>Throughout his entire life, Dani has undergone approximately 150 blood transfusions to stay alive. Because he has had so many, the risk of organ failure is high due to iron overload. Also, this has caused an abnormally high number of antibodies to build up in his body make things even more complicated.</p>
    <p>During 2016 the doctors recommended Palliative care as the only option, an option with many side effects to give him some more time, but not a cure for his illness.</p>
    <p>Even though this typically means nothing can be done, the Cincinnati Children's hospital had multiple 100% matches for Dani in a non-related donor bone marrow bank, something almost as rare as his disease. So the doctors offered to do the bone marrow transplant, which can completely cure Dani and allow him to live a normal life.</p>
    <p>This transplant cannot be performed in his birth place, Costa Rica, due to the complexity of Dani's case and the cost is staggering. This means that we need to raise $913,000 to pay for Dani’s bone marrow transplant, as Cincinnati Children's hospital was accepted him as a candidate for bone marrow transplant.</p>
